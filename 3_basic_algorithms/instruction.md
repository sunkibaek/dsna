# Submission Instructions

## What to Submit

### Required

Answer all 7 problems listed in the previous concepts.

Code solutions must be in a separate file like "problem_1.py". You are able to
submit your answers by uploading a single .zip file or connecting to your GitHub repo.

For each question, create a solution in Python (version 3). All solutions should
be functions named as laid out in the concepts. Feel free to make additional
helper functions or classes as needed.

In the respective "problem_1.py" files, include at least 3 test cases for
each solution.

For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test
and print it to the console".

On the next line, comment out the output you expect to see from that function call.
At least 2 of these must be edge cases, testing inputs such as null values,
empty inputs, unusually large values, et cetera.

Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate text file,
PDF or markdown called "explanation_1.md".

Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided,
but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example,
why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency
(time and space) of your solution.

Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit.

Please take care to complete these requirements when submitting! If for any
reason we are unable to review your submission, we will let you know promptly
so you may resubmit. Resubmitting will start a new window for feedback delivery.
