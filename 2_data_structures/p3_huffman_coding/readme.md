In this problem, two parts were significant:

1. building the tree
   Using a sorted array of nodes, started from the nodes with least value so that
   they get assigned the biggest binary, and the most frequently used values
   assigned smallest binary.

2. traversing the tree to decode

Used a recursive function with 1 or 0 as a guide to decide whether to go to
a left or right node
