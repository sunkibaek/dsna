# 3. How to Solve Problems

## Problem solving procedures

1. Check inputs
1. Check outputs
1. Solve the problem with outside-in approach
    1. Make coarse/high-level solutions
    1. Split parts into sub-procedures
    1. Then work on detail/edge cases
    1. Stubbed answers -> real answers
    1. Simple cases -> edge cases
    1. Develop incrementally, test as you go
